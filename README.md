Visual factors such as viewpoint, pose, illumination and background, are usually condisered as important challenges in person re-identification (re-ID). However, despite the acknowledgement that these factors are influential, quantitative studies on how they affect a re-ID system are still lacking. To derive insights in this scientific campaign, the burning problem needed to be settled is collecting quantitative data. However, it is difficult to control the changes of visual factors in practice and the cost of collecting this kind of data is expensive. To solve this problem, we build a synthetic data engine [PersonX](https://github.com/sxzrt/Instructions-of-the-PersonX-dataset).

## Dissecting Person Re-identification from the Viewpoint of Viewpoint 
Based on the PersonX engine, this paper makes an early attempt in studying a particular factor, **viewpoint**.

Here, we denote viewpoint as the pedestrian rotation angle (as shown in above Figure). Since different views of a person contain different details, the viewpoint of a person influences the visual information contained in the image, which is directly related to the performance of the algorithm. Therefore, we investigate the exact influence of viewpoint on the system from three aspects. 


### The PersonX Dataset
We release 3D models of the identeties and the 1266 models can be downloaded from the following links:<br>
[Baidu Disk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1nXdrniA7IDgJDKq6FexFJA)<br>
[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d2PuKD60qFpugbqYfMHtjKmRj9OUdPG4/view?usp=sharing)<br>
!!! If you want to use these models to generat images by yourself, you can check [the instructions of the dataset](https://github.com/sxzrt/Instructions-of-the-PersonX-dataset).
