## Dissecting Person Re-identification from the Viewpoint of Viewpoint 

Visual factors such as viewpoint, pose, illumination and background, are usually condisered as important challenges in person re-identification (re-ID). However, despite the acknowledgement that these factors are influential, quantitative studies on how they affect a re-ID system are still lacking. To derive insights in this scientific campaign, this paper makes an early attempt in studying a particular factor, viewpoint.

Here, we denote viewpoint as the pedestrian rotation angle (as shown in above Figure). Since different views of a person contain different details, the viewpoint of a person influences the visual information contained in the image, which is directly related to the performance of the algorithm. Therefore, we investigate the exact influence of viewpoint on the system.
